      <h1>About Above The Stack</h1>
      <p>
        Above The Stack is the independent platform where Managed Service
        Providers, vendors, and IT leaders access research, playbooks, and a
        peer community — free from vendor bias and focused on real outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are launching in Europe with a strong emphasis on digital
        sovereignty, compliance, and trust. Our mission is to provide MSPs with
        the knowledge and tools they need to grow in a rapidly changing
        regulatory and technological landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        While our roots are European, our vision is global. We believe that the
        lessons learned here — around sovereignty, security, and sustainable
        growth — can benefit MSPs and technology partners everywhere. As our
        community grows, we welcome perspectives from the United States, Asia,
        and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above The Stack is more than a resource hub — it’s a community. Whether
        you are an MSP seeking clarity, a vendor wanting to better serve your
        partners, or a student exploring the IT channel, you’ll find a place
        here to learn, share, and grow.
