      <p>
        Above The Stack is the independent platform where Managed Service Providers, vendors, and
        IT leaders access research, playbooks, and a peer community — free from vendor bias and
        focused on real outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are launching in Europe with a strong emphasis on digital sovereignty, compliance, and
        trust. Our mission is to equip MSPs with the knowledge and tools they need to grow in a
        rapidly changing regulatory and technological landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        While our roots are European, our vision is global. The lessons learned here — around
        sovereignty, security, and sustainable growth — can benefit MSPs and technology partners
        everywhere. As our community expands, we welcome perspectives from North America, Asia, and
        beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above The Stack is more than a resource hub — it is a community. Whether you are an MSP
        seeking clarity, a vendor wanting to better serve your partners, or a student exploring the
        IT channel, you will find a place here to learn, share, and grow.
